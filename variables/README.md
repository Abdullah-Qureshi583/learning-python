# Variables

A variable is a container used to store data in programming. It holds a value that can change during the execution of a program.

# Declaring Variables

In Python, we can declare a variable by simply writing its name and assigning a value to it. Unlike some other languages, Python does not require `let`, `const`, or `var` to declare a variable.

```python
# Example of variable declaration in Python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True

print(name) // Alice
print(age) // 25
print(is_student) // True
```
